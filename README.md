### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm lucky enough to have a great job working for Microsoft, building and playing with code for a living.  
If you're reading this, I'm hoping you love coding and technology as much as I do! ðŸ˜„

I use these repos to share code snippets and information when collaborating with our partner's developers and colleagues.

- ðŸ”­ In my spare time I work on the Azure Storage Emulator - [Azurite](https://github.com/azure/azurite), my day job involves helping Microsoft ISV partners create cloud solutions using the Microsoft tech stack, Power Platform, O365 and Azure Cloud.
- âš¡ Fun facts: I started out with a Commodore Vic 20 in the 80s, played around with Amiga Basic in the 90s, and spent about 16 years looking at C, C++, C# and assembly in the 2000s debugging issues in Microsoft products.
